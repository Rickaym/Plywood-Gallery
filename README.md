Testing of a gallery created by jupyter cells

## Todo:
* add a copy button to the code cells
* find better cell IDs
* maybe add image alt

 
#### Warning: This repo is only a proof of concept, and very much work in progress



##  Usage:
* add `%%capture_png imgs/example.png` into a directory


* documentation schreiben in github readme:
    * "INCLUDE ONLY" "NOT"
