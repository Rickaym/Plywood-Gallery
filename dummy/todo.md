# Todo:

## Think of dependencies:
```
Ipython , Pillow
```

better path management
thinking about good architecture
think about the module syntax (maybe simpler example for starting?)



# Installation
pip install plywoodX
run generate_template.py
Add your code to `gallery.ipynb`.


## Whislist:
* add a copy button to the code cells
* find better cell IDs so user does not have to give names
* maybe add image alt
