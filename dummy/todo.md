# Todo:

current project structure:

* docs: index.html, generate_enteries.js , minimal_examply.ipynb, that are under actrive development and published on github pages
* dummy: only debugging stuff, todo list
* plywood_gallery: stuff, that will be delivered by pip install
* template: index.html, generate_enteries.js , minimal_examply.ipynb that are used to generate quickstart examples for users.


## Think of dependencies:
```
Ipython , Pillow, ipykernel, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn
```

better path management
thinking about good architecture
think about the module syntax (maybe simpler example for starting?)



# Installation
pip install plywoodX
run generate_template.py
Add your code to `gallery.ipynb`.


## Whislist:
* add a copy button to the code cells
* find better cell IDs so user does not have to give names
* maybe add image alt
